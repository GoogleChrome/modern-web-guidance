# Implement natural interactions

Interfaces feel natural when every input gets an immediate response, motion behaves like a physical object, content follows the user's finger, and nothing depends on a mouse.

## Implementation

### Give every control hover, press, and focus feedback

```css
:where(button) {
  /* example durations */
  transition: box-shadow 150ms ease-out, scale 150ms ease-out;
}
button:hover { box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.2); }
a:hover { text-decoration-thickness: 2px; }
button:active { scale: 0.97; } /* example value */

:where(a, button, input, select, textarea, summary, [tabindex]):focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid CanvasText;
  outline-offset: 3px;
}
```

- Use `:focus-visible` so keyboard users always see a clear focus ring, without showing it on mouse clicks.
- DO NOT remove focus outlines (`outline: none` or `outline: 0`) without providing an equally visible replacement with at least a 3:1 contrast ratio against the page (WCAG 1.4.11). `CanvasText` is the text color for the page's `color-scheme`, so it contrasts with the default page background in light mode, in dark mode (with `color-scheme: light dark`), and in forced colors. If you set your own page background, pick a ring color with 3:1 against it. `currentColor` fails when a button's text color matches the page.
- Make each interaction state look different, including combinations: hover, press, pressing while hovering, and keyboard focus. In the example, hover adds a shadow, press a scale, and focus an outline, so any combination shows each of its parts.

### Open disclosures from their trigger

Popovers and dropdowns should visibly open from the control that triggered them: scale out from the corner touching the trigger, or slide out from its side. Menus and hovercards have their own open motion; follow `menu` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "menu"`) and `hovercard` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "hovercard"`). For other popovers, place the popover next to its trigger and align `transform-origin` with the corner that touches it. To flip dropdowns at viewport edges, see `viewport-aware-dropdowns` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "viewport-aware-dropdowns"`).

```css
.dropdown {
  /* popovertarget makes the trigger the popover's anchor. */
  position-area: bottom span-right;
  inset: auto;
  margin: 0;
  /* The corner touching the trigger; change it whenever the placement changes. */
  transform-origin: top left;
}
/* example durations */
.dropdown:is(:popover-open, .\:popover-open) { animation: fade-in 150ms ease-out both; }
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .dropdown:is(:popover-open, .\:popover-open) {
    /* optional example spring curve, written inline */
    animation: grow 300ms linear(0, 0.45 15%, 1.08 35%, 0.97 55%, 1.01 75%, 1) both, fade-in 150ms ease-out both;
  }
}
@keyframes grow { from { scale: 0.9; } }
@keyframes fade-in { from { opacity: 0; } }
```

- Keep animations on the compositor (`transform`, its individual properties, and `opacity`) and respect reduced-motion preferences; see `motion` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "motion"`). This example animates the opening only; for exit transitions, see `animate-to-from-top-layer` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "animate-to-from-top-layer"`).
- Trigger popovers declaratively using `<button popovertarget="dropdown-id">` (see `declarative-dialog-popover-control` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "declarative-dialog-popover-control"`)) to get native click, keyboard, and dismiss behavior without JavaScript.
- For a springy open, use a `linear()` curve that overshoots slightly before settling (an output value above 1); see `physics-based-easing` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "physics-based-easing"`).

### Make horizontal scrollers swipeable

Any horizontally scrollable row of items, such as a carousel, gallery, or row of chips, should scroll natively and snap to its items.

```css
.scroller {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
  overflow-x: auto;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}
.scroller > * {
  flex: 0 0 85%; /* example item width */
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}
```

- Native overflow scrolling gives swiping its physics and momentum, and snapping makes each swipe come to rest on an item, with no touch listeners.
- If none of the scroller's items contains a link, button, or other focusable element, make the scroller itself focusable and labeled (`<div class="scroller" role="region" aria-label="Featured items" tabindex="0">`), so keyboard users can reach it and scroll it with the arrow keys. When items are focusable, tabbing to them already scrolls them into view.
- To highlight the item that snaps into place, see `carousel-snap-highlights` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "carousel-snap-highlights"`). To swipe a list item aside to reveal actions, see `swipe-to-reveal` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "swipe-to-reveal"`). For side menus that close when swiped away, see `navigation-drawer` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "navigation-drawer"`).

### Add motion blur to large, fast movements (optional)

For large, rapid translations (such as a full-screen sheet sliding into view), a subtle, temporary blur softens the movement. `filter` doesn't run only on the compositor, so keep blur to large, brief movements, skip it for small controls or slow transitions, and always guard it with a reduced-motion media query.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .sheet.is-open { animation: sheet-in 300ms ease-out both; } /* example duration */
}
@keyframes sheet-in {
  from { translate: 0 100%; filter: blur(6px); } /* example blur radius */
}
```

### Make every action reachable without a mouse

- Use `<button>` for actions and `<a>` with an `href` for navigation. Both receive keyboard focus and activate on <kbd>Enter</kbd>; buttons also activate on <kbd>Space</kbd>.
- Menus and dropdowns may open on hover, but never only on hover: they also open on click, tap, and keyboard activation, stay open while the pointer moves onto them, and close with <kbd>Esc</kbd> (WCAG 2.1.1, 1.4.13).
- Controls or details revealed in place on hover, such as card actions, must also appear on keyboard focus and be visible by default on devices without hover:

```css
.card .actions {
  opacity: 0;

  .card:hover &,
  .card:focus-within & { opacity: 1; }

  @media (hover: none) { opacity: 1; }
}
```

For tooltips and previews triggered on hover, focus, or long-press, see `interest-triggered-tooltips` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "interest-triggered-tooltips"`) and `interest-triggered-action-previews` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "interest-triggered-action-previews"`).

## Fallback strategies

### Fallbacks & browser support for Popover

Baseline status for Popover: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-01-27.
Supported by: Chrome 116 (Aug 2023), Edge 116 (Aug 2023), Firefox 125 (Apr 2024), Safari 17 (Sep 2023), and Safari iOS 18.3 (Jan 2025).

The Popover API is mostly **progressive enhancement**, but its defining behaviors — top-layer promotion, light-dismiss, and `popovertarget` invocation — have no CSS-only equivalent. Older browsers need a polyfill, or a manual fallback if you would rather not ship one.

**Polyfill:** To support the `popover` attribute in older browsers, conditionally load [`@oddbird/popover-polyfill`](https://github.com/oddbird/popover-polyfill). **MANDATORY:** Feature detect by checking for the `popover` property on `HTMLElement.prototype`, and load the polyfill **only** when native support is missing — do NOT load it unconditionally.

With a bundler or import map:

```js
// MANDATORY: Feature detect 'popover' on HTMLElement.prototype.
if (!("popover" in HTMLElement.prototype)) {
  import("@oddbird/popover-polyfill");
}
```

Without a bundler, import from a CDN inside a `<script type="module">`:

```html
<script type="module">
  if (!("popover" in HTMLElement.prototype)) {
    import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/popover-polyfill@latest/dist/popover.min.js");
  }
</script>
```

**Styling caveat:** The polyfill cannot define the real `:popover-open` pseudo-class, so it applies a `.\:popover-open` class instead. **MANDATORY:** Combine the two with `:is()` or `:where()`, otherwise browsers that lack `:popover-open` discard the entire rule:

```css
[popover]:is(:popover-open, .\:popover-open) {
  display: block;
}
```

Alternatively, for a legacy fallback without a polyfill, use `position: fixed` and manually calculate coordinates via `getBoundingClientRect()` or rely on default positioning with `inset: auto` if that's acceptable for the use case.

### Anchor positioning

Baseline status for the html.elements.button.popovertarget.implicit_anchor_reference capability: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2026-01-13.
Supported by: Chrome 133 (Feb 2025), Edge 133 (Feb 2025), Firefox 147 (Jan 2026), and Safari 26 (Sep 2025).

Without support, `inset: auto` leaves the popover at the top-left corner of the viewport. When `CSS.supports('position-area: bottom')` is false, set the popover's `top` and `left` from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()` in a `beforetoggle` event listener.

### Linear easing

Baseline status for linear() easing: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2023-12-11.
Supported by: Chrome 113 (May 2023), Edge 113 (May 2023), Firefox 112 (Apr 2023), and Safari 17.2 (Dec 2023).

Browsers without `linear()` drop the declaration that uses it, so precede it with one that uses a keyword such as `ease-out`, as the fade-in above does. Write `linear()` inline, not through a custom property, or the earlier declaration is discarded too.
