# Creating Persistent App Tours

Onboarding tours require overlays that persist while users interact with the highlighted features. Unlike auto popovers, manual popovers do not close when the user clicks elsewhere on the page. Combining `popover="manual"` with CSS Anchor Positioning allows you to create non-modal, tethered tour steps. This pattern is used to introduce new/updated content. There is no explicit relationship between the popovers themselves, so dismissing the first popover doesn't assume that the user needs to immediately move to the second popover to learn about the related feature - they can find out about it when they navigate to that section of the page.

## Recommended Implementation

### HTML
```html
<div id="feature-target">Highlight this feature</div>

<dialog id="tour-step" popover="manual" aria-labelledby="tour-title">
  <!-- Assume an <h1> precedes this element in the full document outline -->
  <h2 id="tour-title">Start a review</h2>
  <p>Begin the process by starting a review of the submitted document.</p>
  <button popovertarget="tour-step" popovertargetaction="hide">Got it</button>
</dialog>
```

### CSS
```css
#feature-target {
  anchor-name: --feature-target;
}

#tour-step {
  popover: manual;
  position-anchor: --feature-target;
  position-area: right center;
  inset: auto;
  margin: 1rem;
  padding: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  background: aliceblue;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
const tourStep = document.getElementById('tour-step');
tourStep.showPopover();

// At this point, as this is an initial onboarding tour popover, set the rest of the document to be inert. Ensure that the onboarding modal popover is not a child of this element, otherwise it too will be rendered inert and therefore inaccessible.
// Ensure that inert is removed once the initial onboarding tour has finished
const main = document.querySelector("main");
main.inert = true;

// MANDATORY: Programmatically route focus into the non-modal popover so keyboard/assistive technology users immediately perceive the new context
tourStep.querySelector('button').focus();
```

## Implementation Guidelines

* **MANDATORY:** Use `popover="manual"` to prevent the tour step from closing accidentally during user interaction.
* **MANDATORY:** Mark the container with `role="dialog"` and link its heading via `aria-labelledby`.
* **MANDATORY:** Shift programmatic focus inside the popover immediately after opening to prevent focus abandonment.
* **DO** use CSS Anchor Positioning to tether the tour step to the specific feature being explained.
* **DO** provide an explicit "Close" or "Next" button within the popover that uses `popovertargetaction="hide"`.

## Accessibility considerations

Popovers should provide sufficient context around the features they're introducing, to be understood independently. **DON'T** make the content in a popover heavily reliant on content outside of it to be understood. For example: "New feature. Click here", relies heavily on visual information that people may not have, or may not be able to access (particularly if the content outside the popover is `inert`). Instead, something like: "New chat functionality. Start a chat to review items with fellow members", is much easier to understand when read in isolation. Tour popovers should begin with a heading, so that as to provide context to the content in the popover, as well as to provide an easy way for people using screen readers to navigate to them, when used in a non-modal way.

Focus must not be moved to these popovers on page load. This is to both prevent confusion from hijacking focus. It's likely that when navigating to the page, the person using the functionality may have a goal for they want to complete, therefore, tours for new features should be treated as supplemental information and not distract the user.

In keeping this information supplemental, the popover should be positioned in the DOM immediately before the functionality/control it relates to. This will help people using screen readers to easily identify the relationship between the popover and related content when reading through the page. When the popover is dismissed, focus should move to the related control/functionality.

Content in popovers must scale in size and remain visible when resizing text up to 200% to adhere to WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA). Content in popovers must remain visible when adjusting text styling and spacing with CSS to adhere to 1.4.12 Text Spacing (Level AA). Content in popovers must remain visible, or can be accessed still, when using a viewport sized to 320 by 256 CSS pixels to adhere to 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA).

Use of non-modal popovers may result in controls being obscured when they receive focus, which would result in a fail against WCAG 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (Level AA), as focused items cannot be completely obscured. While there may not be generic guidance to completely mitigate against this issue, consider strategies that adjust the position of the tooltip or its presence. This includes ensuring that tooltips do not obscure interactive elements as they receive focus via keyboard. If the tooltip is likely to obscure an interactive element when it receives focus, either change the position of the tooltip to prevent focus being obscured, or dismiss the tooltip if it is no longer relevant to the user.

## Fallback strategies

### Fallbacks & browser support for Popover

Baseline status for Popover: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-01-27.
Supported by: Chrome 116 (Aug 2023), Edge 116 (Aug 2023), Firefox 125 (Apr 2024), Safari 17 (Sep 2023), and Safari iOS 18.3 (Jan 2025).

The Popover API is mostly **progressive enhancement**, but its defining behaviors — top-layer promotion, light-dismiss, and `popovertarget` invocation — have no CSS-only equivalent. Older browsers need a polyfill, or a manual fallback if you would rather not ship one.

**Polyfill:** To support the `popover` attribute in older browsers, conditionally load [`@oddbird/popover-polyfill`](https://github.com/oddbird/popover-polyfill). **MANDATORY:** Feature detect by checking for the `popover` property on `HTMLElement.prototype`, and load the polyfill **only** when native support is missing — do NOT load it unconditionally.

With a bundler or import map:

```js
// MANDATORY: Feature detect 'popover' on HTMLElement.prototype.
if (!Object.hasOwn(HTMLElement.prototype, "popover")) {
  import("@oddbird/popover-polyfill");
}
```

If not using a package manager, import from a CDN, e.g. `"https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/popover-polyfill@latest/dist/popover.min.js"`.

Caveats when using the polyfill:
- Do NOT use the `popover` IDL attribute for any code that may run before the polyfill is fully loaded. It will not be mirrored as an attribute, the popover will not be picked up by the polyfill, and the property will be shadowing the accessor the polyfill adds forever. Use `setAttribute()`/`removeAttribute()` instead.
- **Styling caveat:** The polyfill cannot define the real `:popover-open` pseudo-class, so it applies a `.\:popover-open` class instead. **MANDATORY:** Combine the two with `:is()` or `:where()`, otherwise browsers that lack `:popover-open` discard the entire rule:

```css
[popover]:is(:popover-open, .\:popover-open) {
  display: block;
}
```

### Fallbacks & browser support for Anchor positioning

Browser support for Anchor positioning: Limited availability.
Supported by: Safari 27 (Sep 2026).
Unsupported in: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

Without CSS Anchor Positioning, tethered elements such as `[popover]` overlays fall back to their default user-agent placement (centered in the viewport for popovers). Depending on whether spatial tethering is required for your use case, either conditionally load the polyfill or gate your positioning rules with `@supports`.

#### Option 1: Polyfill (`@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning`)

When the positioned element must stay spatially tethered to its trigger in unsupported browsers, conditionally load the `@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning` package.

**MANDATORY:** Feature-detect support via `CSS.supports("anchor-name: --a")` (or `"anchorName" in CSSStyleDeclaration.prototype`), and load the polyfill **only** when native support is missing — do NOT load it unconditionally.

With a bundler or import map:

```js
// MANDATORY: Feature-detect anchor positioning support before loading the polyfill.
if (!CSS.supports("anchor-name: --a")) {
  import("@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning");
}
```

Without a bundler, import from a CDN inside a `<script type="module">`:

```html
<!-- MANDATORY: Conditionally install the anchor positioning polyfill -->
<script type="module">
  if (!CSS.supports("anchor-name: --a")) {
    import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning");
  }
</script>
```

**Polyfill caveats:**
- **No implicit anchors:** The polyfill does not support implicit anchor associations (such as those created by `popovertarget`, `commandfor`, `interestfor`, or `showPopover({ source })`). You **MUST** set a unique explicit `anchor-name` on each trigger and a matching `position-anchor` on the positioned element.
- **No `position-area` with `position-try-fallbacks`:** `position-area` with `position-try-fallbacks` is not supported by the polyfill. When using the polyfill on elements needing fallbacks, position elements using `anchor()` functions on inset properties (`top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`) with `inset: auto` instead of `position-area`.
- **Do not wrap polyfilled rules in `@supports`:** Browsers without native anchor positioning evaluate `@supports (position-area: ...)` and `@supports (anchor-name: --a)` to `false` and discard the block before the polyfill can process it.

```css
.trigger {
  /* MANDATORY: Each trigger and positioned element pair must share a unique anchor name. */
  anchor-name: --my-trigger;
}

[popover].anchored-overlay {
  position-anchor: --my-trigger;
  /* MANDATORY: Use anchor() on inset properties rather than position-area when using the polyfill on elements needing position-try-fallbacks. */
  inset: auto;
  top: anchor(bottom);
  left: anchor(left);
  margin: 0;
}
```

#### Option 2: Progressive enhancement with `@supports` (no polyfill)

If you do not ship the polyfill, **DO NOT** set `inset: auto` or `margin: 0` unconditionally on a `[popover]` element that relies on `position-area` or `anchor()`. In browsers without anchor positioning, `inset: auto` overrides the user-agent centering (`inset: 0; margin: auto`) while `position-area` is ignored, leaving the popover stranded at `(0, 0)` or overlapping its trigger.

Instead, gate `inset: auto` and `margin: 0` inside `@supports` for the specific positioning feature used (for example, `@supports (position-area: block-end)` or `@supports (top: anchor(bottom))`) so unsupported browsers retain the default centered popover placement, or provide a matching `@supports not (...)` fallback layout (such as a fixed bottom sheet):

```css
@supports (position-area: block-end) {
  [popover].anchored-overlay {
    inset: auto;
    margin: 0;
    position-area: block-end span-inline-end;
    position-try-fallbacks: flip-block, flip-inline, flip-block flip-inline;
  }
}

@supports not (position-area: block-end) {
  /* Optional: override default popover centering with a fixed bottom bar */
  [popover].anchored-overlay {
    position: fixed;
    inset: auto 0 0 0;
    width: auto;
    margin: 0;
  }
}
```
